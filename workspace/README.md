# Coordinator Workspace

This is where the Coordinator agent keeps its working files.

## Structure

- `daily-notes/` - Daily progress and observations
- `agent-templates/` - CLAUDE.md templates for new agents
- `task-ideas/` - Potential work items and projects

## Usage

The Coordinator uses this space to:
- Plan work assignments
- Design new agent specifications
- Track progress and blockers
- Prepare setup guides for humans

All coordination with other agents happens through GitHub issues and the main chat.
